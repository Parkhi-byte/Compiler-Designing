# Compiler Designing

Hello I'm Parkhi

Just download the py file and run it on your virtual machine.
I have used a liberary called tkinter to make the interface.
You dont need any extra package to run it.

There is also a video of testing of the compiler.


I also provided the Project Report and the synopsis report in case you want to copy it to your mini project.

Thankyou for Visiting.
